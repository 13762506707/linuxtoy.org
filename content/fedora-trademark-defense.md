以下消息引自[Fedora中文邮件列表](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/chinese)。

可能是有人在某国抢注 Fedora 商标，Red Hat 法律部门需要一些 **2007 年 1
月 30 日之前，Fedora  
商标已经被使用的证据**。例如，**Fedora 5 或 6
的盒装版，报纸和杂志，其他出版物，各种其他商品，等等**。

可以将照片或扫描件发送给

>   
>  Red Hat Legal provides numerous services as counsel to the Fedora  
>  community, including defending Fedora trademarks against possible  
>  encroachment. Occasionally, people who have no connection to our  
>  community attempt to use the Fedora trademark to signify business  
>  efforts that have no connection to the Fedora Project, our  
>  distribution, or the Fedora community.  
>   
>  Red Hat Legal is currently working on just such a defense. They've  
>  asked me to pass on a request for assistance in gathering physical  
>  evidence of our use of the Fedora logo worldwide prior to *January
> 30,  
>  2007*.  
>   
>  Here's what Red Hat Legal needs. Please read this description  
>  carefully, and DO NOT REPLY to this list with attachments. That will  
>  keep the list usable by its many subscribers. Please reply directly  
>  to the addresses listed at the bottom of this email, and only if you  
>  have something that meets one or more of these criteria.  
>   
>  * An item bearing the current Fedora logo that was produced or  
>  available in China prior to January 30, 2007 is optimal, but  
>  anything available worldwide would suffice.  
>   
>  * Tangible objects -- paper brochures, CDs, buttons, mousepads,  
>  balloons, webpage printouts with a print date from before 30  
>  January, 2007, T-shirts, etc. -- that were in existence before that  
>  date. For example, a T-shirt that says "Fedora 2005" on it would be  
>  good, or perhaps one with just a release number that's before  
>  January 30, 2007.  
>   
>  * We have a Fedora 5 CD, but any others from before 30 January 2007  
>  would be good. (AFAIK Fedora Core 6 is the only other applicable  
>  release, since FC5-FC6 were the two distros we produced with the  
>  logo prior to January 30, 2007.)[1]  
>   
>  * We're looking for a a hard copy of this Linux magazine from  
>  March, 2006:  
>  http://www.linux-mag.com/id/2532  
>  http://www.linux-mag.com/channel/back-issues/march2006  
>  ...plus any other magazines, ads, news articles, etc. from before  
>  January 30, 2007 that talk about Fedora.  
>   
>  If it's not obvious from the object itself what the date is, Red Hat  
>  Legal may ask you to sign an affidavit explaining what the object is  
>  and how you know it existed before January 30, 2007.  
>   
>  Again, PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS LIST WITH ATTACHMENTS.  
>   
>  Photos or scans of anything like CD's, T-shirts, keyrings, mouse
> pads,  
>  etc. are acceptable. You can email these directly to edutton at  
>  redhat dot com.  
>   
>  If the item is paper (like the magazine), you can mail it directly
