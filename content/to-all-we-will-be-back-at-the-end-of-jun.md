To all the friends concerning LinuxToy,

致所有关心LinuxToy的友人，

I, on Toy and all the authors' behalf, apologize for our absence these
days unofficially (Unauthorized by Toy).

I myself are quite busy these days, for the coming exams. As to me,
Human Neuropsychology is much more difficult than anything else. But no
matter what happens, I will defiantly bring my reports back **at the end
of Jun**.

The situation of our leader and administrator, Toy,  is not very clear.
It's not a long time since I became one of the authors. Right now, the
only thing we could do probably is to give our best wishes.

我，代表Toy及所有作者们，为最近一段时间来的停滞表示非官方的道歉（未得到Toy授权）。

我自己最近在为即将到来的考试忙碌着，对我来说，没有什么能比人类神经心理学更难的了。但是不管怎样，我将在**6月底**时恢复内容的更新。

我们的领袖及管理员Toy
兄的情况并不十分清楚，我加入这个写作团队的时间并不长。现在，我们唯一可能做的事就是向Toy致以最好的祝福。  
This Post will be deleted after I first add news at the end of Jun,
obviously nobody wants the LinuxToy becomes a personal blog. If someone
comes back before me, please feel free to delete it.

该条内容将在6月底我首次添加新内容时删除，显然没人希望LinuxToy成为个人博客。如果有人提前启动更新了，请删除本条内容。  
Thank you very much for all of your comments, suggestions, to our truly
friends.

非常感谢你们的评论及建议，你们是我们最真诚的朋友。
